%We start by telling LaTeX that this is a dragonfly report. Note that this format
% is interchangeable with AEBR. Optionally we can say that
% it is a draft (which will add watermarks, line number and extra line spacing). 
\documentclass[draft]{dragonfly-report}

% A report requires two titles. The first is the short title. This is used for the 
% footer text. The second is the full title. This goes on the front of the report. 
% You are only allowed to use two LaTeX macros in the title: \\ and \emph. If others
% are used there may be issues.
\title{Black petrel overlap with trawl and longline fisheries}{Overlap of the distribution of black petrel (\emph{Procellaria parkinsoni}) with  New Zealand trawl and longline fisheries}


% Reports also have a subtitle. This goes below the title on the front page.
\subtitle{Draft Final Research Report prepared for the Ministry for Primary Industries, as part of project SEA2013-06}

%Normally the inside cover citation uses the subtitle text at the end of the 
%citation. However this can be overriden using \citationnote
%\citationnote{A cool alternative}

% Authors must be included for a report. They should be listed with their full names
% with each author separated by \and.
\author{John Smith \and Jane E. Smith \and Jack Smith}

% In this example I have used the subcaption package to create a subfloat. These are
% when you have more than one picture within a single figure, and each gets it's own
% internal caption.
\usepackage{subcaption}

% Optionally you can set an image to go on the titlepage. If this is not set it will
% default to the wing image as a banner accross the top of the page. If an image is
% included it should have a resulution of >= 600dpi, and ideally should be sized at
% 210x110 mmm. Wider and taller images may not work correctly. If the image is shorter
% than written, the width should not be reduced. 
%\titleimage{pattern}

% Since the title image can be under a creative commons licence 
% there is a command to attribute the image on the inside cover. The first argument
% is the name of an image file showing the licence being used. The second is text 
% describing the attribution. It may include a link, for example:
\singleimage{by-nc-nd}{https://www.flickr.com/photos/naoc0804/13923065676/in/explore-2014-04-20}
% Don't use the leftimage, middleimage, or rightimage commands


% Dragonfly reports all have a licence attached. The default dragonfly licence can
% be used with \bydragonfly. The crown licence can be used with \bycrown. 
% You can also directly enter whichever licence is appropriate. 
\licence{\bydragonfly}

% The lipsum package should not be used in a real report. It is used to generate
% filler text to test templates.
\usepackage{lipsum}

% This is the location of the bibliography file.
\addbibresource{test.bib}

\usepackage{tabularx}
\usepackage{multirow}
% The actual document contents begin after here.
