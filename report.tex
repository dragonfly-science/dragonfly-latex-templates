%We start by telling LaTeX that this is a dragonfly report. Note that this format
% is interchangeable with AEBR. Optionally we can say that
% it is a draft (which will add watermarks, line number and extra line spacing). 
\documentclass[draft]{dragonfly-report}

% A report requires two titles. The first is the short title. This is used for the 
% footer text. The second is the full title. This goes on the front of the report. 
% You are only allowed to use two LaTeX macros in the title: \\ and \emph. If others
% are used there may be issues.
\title{Example}{An Example\\ Report about \emph{sheep}}

% Reports also have a subtitle. This goes below the title on the front page.
\subtitle{A report for testing purposes}

%Normally the inside cover citation uses the subtitle text at the end of the 
%citation. However this can be overriden using \citationnote
%\citationnote{A cool alternative}

% Authors must be included for a report. They should be listed with their full names
% with each author separated by \and.
\author{John Smith \and Jane E. Smith \and Jack Smith}

% In this example I have used the subcaption package to create a subfloat. These are
% when you have more than one picture within a single figure, and each gets it's own
% internal caption.
\usepackage{subcaption}


% Optionally you can set an image to go on the titlepage. If this is not set it will
% default to the wing image as a banner accross the top of the page. If an image is
% included it should have a resulution of >= 600dpi, and ideally should be sized at
% 210x110 mmm. Wider and taller images may not work correctly. If the image is shorter
% than written, the width should not be reduced. 
%\titleimage{pattern}

% Since the title image can be comprised of images under the creative commons licence 
% there are commands to attribute these images on the inside cover. The first argument
% is the name of an image file showing the licence being used. The second is a link 
% to the image.

% Dragonfly reports all have a licence attached. The default dragonfly licence can
% be used with \bydragonfly. The crown licence can be used with \bycrown. 
% You can also directly enter whichever licence is appropriate. 
\licence{\bydragonfly}

% The lipsum package should not be used in a real report. It is used to generate
% filler text to test templates.

% The actual document contents begin after here. 
\begin{document}

% Documents that are provided to MPI working  groups require a special cover sheet
% when they are printed as a draft. Including this file will create such a title sheet
% when the draft option is enabled. Do to the range of working groups and goals that 
% need to be acheived, users may need to edit the mpiDraftCover.tex file themselves
% to put in the correct details.
