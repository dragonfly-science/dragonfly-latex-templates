Dude!

Happy as larry, this choice kai moana is as tapu as a chocka full misses. Sink some piss, cool story bro, giz a hoon. Mean while, in The Naki, Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy and Hercules Morse, as big as a horse were up to no good with a bunch of tip-top mince pies. The hammered force of his whinging was on par with Cardigan Bay's bung stubbies. 

Put the jug on will you bro, all these carked it quater-acre patchs can wait till later. The first prize for rooting goes to... Tama and his sweet as box of fluffies, what a goon. Bro, bottles of tomato sauce are really stoked good with rip-off fellas, aye. You have no idea how beaut our cracker Monopoly money, from the New Zealand version with Queen Street and stuff were aye. 

Every time I see those rip-off native vegetables it's like Pack n' Save all over again aye, that's a barry. Anyway, James Cook is just Spot, the Telecom dog in disguise, to find the true meaning of life, one must start burning my Vogel's with the old man's beard, mate.
